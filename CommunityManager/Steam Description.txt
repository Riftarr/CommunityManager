This mod allows players to modify the student count generated by communities, as well as their tuition. By default victory conditions are adjusted accordingly.

This is by no means a perfect re-balance of the game, so many of the game features are balanced around an expected number of students. However I believe it introduces enough of a new challenge to make up for it.

[h1]Explanation of the Settings:[/h1]
- Student Multiplier -
Ranges from 1 to 20, sets the number that the communities natural spawn count is multiplied by.
Defaults to 10.

- Tuition Multiplier -
Ranges from 0.01 to 5, sets the number that the communities expected tuition is multiplied by.
Defaults to 1.25 (I originally  set this to 15% but there is a surprising strain on facilities and you need a little boost to maintain a sense of the games original difficulty)

- Enable Student Victory Adjustments -
Set on or off (1 or 0) to enable various adjustments to challenges involving students counts. If you turn this off you could potentially 'win' the game in the first season...

- Reset -
Resets to [b]mod defaults[/b] [i][u]not game defaults[/u][/i]!
